Site in Progress [Live Demo](https://silly-swanson-f33f6c.netlify.com/) 


1. Create a new Angular File 

```javascript 
cd <your-projects-folder>
ng new project4
cd project4
```

When prompted select `yes` to, **`‘Would you like to add Angular Routing?’`**

Next Select `css` to **`‘Which stylesheet format would you like to use?’`**

2. Start up the development server

`npm start`

Open up your favorite web browser and go to: `http://localhost:4200/`

3. Let us architect our application by using encapsulated components

Let us generate the files by typing 
`ng g component page`
Into the Terminal

4. Some packages we will use include:

`npm i --save @angular/material @angular/animations`

`npm i --save @angular/cdk`
